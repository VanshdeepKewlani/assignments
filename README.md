WalletHub Assignments


The WalletHub Assignments are split into two parts:
Assignment1 – In this user signs-in Facebook and posts a feed. Once this is done, we need to verify the feed.

Assignment2 – In this user signs-in to Wallethub site and provides star rating and writes review text. Once this is posted, user has to verify whether the Reviews are correct or not.

Common Logic between both Assignment1 and Assignment2

     TestContext – This acts as a main class to access the objects of core classes in the Framework

enums – This package contains the enum Context which acts as a global storage repository inside the package

managers – This package contains the code for managing the Driver related code and handling of pages
      DriverManager – This class contains all the logic related to handling of WebDriver e.g. launching and closing browser, navigating to URL etc. It also contains code of reading the properties files present in /src/test/resources
     PageObjectManager – This class contains the logic for managing the object creation of Pages thus ensuring we do not have to worry about issues related to pages like NullPointerException in case page object creation code is missing
